# Coding-Quiz

Hello! This weeks project consisted of creating a quiz from scratch! This involved using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and DOM elements. The quiz testes your knowledge on basic Javascript must-knows. It's very simple. You have 60 seconds to answer five simple questions. More than enough time! Though, there is a penalty for incorrect answers. 10 seconds would be subtracted from your time... so try not to miss any! At the end you can save your score, (your time left), and your initials. Below is a screenshot of what the main page looks like and you can find the link at the bottom. Check it out!
